NAME

    plastic - NES emulator with graphical (GUI) and terminal (TUI) interfaces.

SYNOPSIS

    plastic [rom-file]
    plastic_tui [rom-file] [-a]

DESCRIPTION

    plastic is an NES emulator written in Rust, designed to run NES games with both a graphical (GUI) and a terminal-based (TUI) interface.

    The graphical interface (plastic) can be launched without any arguments (though it can be started from the terminal with a ROM file) and provides a user-friendly graphical experience.

    The terminal-based interface (plastic_tui) allows users to run the emulator in the terminal with optional flags for additional control.

    Saved states are stored at the following path:
    ~/.local/share/plastic/saved_states

OPTIONS

    plastic [rom-file] 
        Launches the emulator with the graphical interface. While arguments are optional, specifying a ROM file as an argument is recommended for immediate gameplay.


    plastic_tui [rom-file] [-a]
        Launches the emulator with the terminal-based interface. The following options are available:
        - rom-file: Specifies the NES ROM file to load.
        - -a: Disables audio output while running in TUI mode.
